    <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
    <p>A hero is someone that one tries to emulate and become in many, if not all facets of life. A hero is someone to look up to, that witholds one's morals and is righteous in the mind of the person for which they are the hero.</p>
    <p>Recently, I have been blessed to watch Keith Lee on TikTok. He is a former MMA Fighter turned food critic through TikTok. He is a morally righteous man in my opinion, and aids small businesses (in many cases) by reviewing their food. Keith is someone I strive to be like; he is honest, empathetic, pure, kind-hearted, and speaks his mind in order to help others.</p>
